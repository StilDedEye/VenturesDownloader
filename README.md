# VENTURES DOWNLOADER

### A YouTube downloader made with the pytube module

**Ventures Downloader**, based on the public **Python module** [_**Pytube**_](https://pytube.io/en/latest/), is a simple command-line application that allows you to download _**.mp4**_ and _**.mp3**_ files from almost any YouTube video.

It is designed to be as simple as possible, which is why it's only available in its CMD version. This also makes it _**ad-free**_.

## How to set up

1.  Download the latest **VenturesInstaller.zip** file from the [_releases page_](https://github.com/StilDedEye/VenturesDownloader/releases).
2.  Unzip it.
3.  Run **VenturesDownloader.exe** and let the program install the latest components.
4.  Now the software is ready. Any time you want to use it, just run **VenturesDownloader.exe**.

Any downloaded files can always be found in the program's folder.

## Software Updates

Ventures Downloader quickly checks for new versions each time you run it. If a new release is found, it will be installed. However, only **downloadScript.exe** _(which contains the script for downloading videos)_ may be auto-updated. If changes are made to other software components, you will need to install them manually. In such cases, we will always notify you through the software. ***Most of these updates are optional.***

### Manual Updates

This is the recommended way to update:

1.  Delete **version.txt** from the program's folder.
2.  Follow the setup guide to download the latest files.
3.  Replace the old files with the new ones.
4.  Run **VenturesDownloader.exe** and let the program install the latest components.
